The CORBA example is the most complicated of the examples. It
aims to show how to use JDBC & Java2's ORB to access PostgreSQL.

To compile:

Type "make corba" to build the example. This will create a new directory
stock which contains the stubs needed by the orb, and all required classes
under the example/corba directory.

To run:

NOTE: To run, you will need 3 shells on Win32 (under unix you can get away
with two shells):

1: Start the naming service

Unix:	tnameserv -ORBInitialPort 1050 &
Win32:	tnameserv -ORBInitialPort 1050

2: Start the StockServer

	java example.corba.StockServer 3 jdbc:postgresql:dbase user passwd -ORBInitialPort 1050

Where:
	3	Number of concurrent sessions to allow
	dbase	The database (including a hostname if required)
	user	The PostgreSQL user name
	passwd	The password

3: Using a fresh shell, run the client:

	java example.corba.StockClient -ORBInitialPort 1050
